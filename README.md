# Machine-Learning-Portfolio

This repository contains my end-to-end machine learning work:
- Algorithms implemented from scratch and using sklearn
- Clear mathematical intuition behind models
- Proper evaluation, feature engineering, and pipelines
- Real-world projects with clean structure

## Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Learning Path
- ML theory & implementation via 100 Days of ML (CampusX)
- Math intuition: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability & Statistics
